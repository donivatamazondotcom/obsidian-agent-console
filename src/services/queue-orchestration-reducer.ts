/**
 * queue-orchestration-reducer — the single owner of the pending-message slot
 * and the flush-vs-hold decision for the queue-next-message feature (#82).
 *
 * Why this exists (see [[ChatPanel lifecycle harness proposal]] and
 * [[Queue Orchestration Reducer]]): pending-message orchestration was spread
 * across two slots (`useMessageQueue` AND `useLazySession.queueRef`) and three
 * ChatPanel effects (connect-flush, busy-state, turn-end flush). The
 * load-bearing decision — at turn-end, dispatch the queued message through the
 * RAW send, never the re-enqueuing lazy wrapper — lived as a code COMMENT in a
 * ChatPanel `useEffect`, not as a tested invariant. Re-wire one `dispatch:`
 * argument back to the wrapper and every test stayed green while the Q4
 * silent-drop regression returned.
 *
 * This reducer folds that scattered logic into one pure
 * `(state, event) -> { state, effects[] }` fold. The crux: the flush is a
 * declarative `{ kind: "flushDispatch", message }` effect with **no
 * dispatch-choice field**. The adapter (ChatPanel) maps it to the raw send
 * unconditionally — there is structurally no way to route a flush through the
 * re-enqueuing wrapper, so the Q4 wiring blind spot is closed by construction.
 *
 * Convergence: same pure-decision + exhaustive + fast-check property-test
 * pattern as `decideSessionIntent` (utils/agent-switch.ts) and the
 * `tab-agent-invariant` validator. No React, no Obsidian — unit-testable in
 * isolation, and drivable from the `fc.commands` lifecycle model.
