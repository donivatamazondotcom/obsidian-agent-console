/**
 * Button-activation orchestration (A2UI-I01).
 *
 * WHY THIS EXISTS: the refocus-after-activation must fire at DISPATCH time.
 * ACP `session/prompt` resolves only when the whole streamed turn ends (the
 * I173 class — see `sendAndReturnFocus`), so any refocus awaited behind
 * `sendDetached`'s promise lands at turn end, minutes late. The round-1 fix
 * made exactly that mistake and failed the human re-check.
 *
 * Sequence: gate on `canSendNow` (no refocus on a refused activation — the
 * click did nothing), start the detached send, refocus IMMEDIATELY, and
 * return the send promise for the pending/answered lifecycle (T11: a false
 * resolution re-enables the surface).
 *
 * Pure over injected seams (port, clock, refocus effect) — unit-testable
 * against a never-resolving send, which is the precise failure shape.
